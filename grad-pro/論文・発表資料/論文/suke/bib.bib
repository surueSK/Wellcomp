@article{Fortin1999,
	Abstract = {In previous experiments, the amount of interference between time production and visual or memory search tasks was shown not to be related to the level of difficulty of the search task per se, but instead to the amount of processing in short-term memory required in the search task. The first experiment of the present study verified whether the amount of interference between time production and a short-term memory task may be related to the level of difficulty of the short-term memory task. Two versions of a memory task, with and without processing of order information, were combined with a temporal interval production task in a concurrent processing condition. As is shown in a control reaction time task, processing order information increased the level of difficulty of the memory search task. In the concurrent processing condition, the interference between short-term memory processing and time production was stronger when the level of difficulty of the short-term memory search task was increased by requiring that order information be processed. The results of Experiment 2 showed that the amount of interference between a similar short-term memory task and time production seems not to be related to the amount of order information that must be maintained during the time production task. This dissociation between the effects of processing and the maintenance of order information is compatible with a similar dissociation, observed in previous experiments, between the effects of processing and those of maintaining item information in short-term memory on concurrent time production.},

@article{Hare1963,
	Abstract = { Fifty-one nursing students were asked to estimate the lengths of 5- and 20-sec. intervals under two conditions: with instructions not to count and with instructions to count to themselves. Significant negative correlations were obtained between MAS scores and the estimation of the 20-sec. intervals, while correlations with the estimates of the 5-sec. intervals were negative but not significant. Although these results are inconsistent with previous findings, an attempt was made to interpret them in terms of the utilization of cues relevant to the passage of time. },

	Abstract = {The influence of basic dimensions of personality, such as extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism, on estimation of time still appears to be unclear. Therefore, in the present study the relationship between Eysenck's basic dimensions of personality and time estimation was investigated in 34 male Ss. After filling in the short version of a German adaptation of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, Ss were required to reproduce target durations ranging from 5 to 40 sec. As a measure of performance, reproduction ratio scores, representing directional errors, and absolute error scores were computed. Correlational analyses revealed no indication of a linear relationship between neuroticism and time estimation. However, there was a tendency for extraverts to overestimate time and to make less accurate time judgments relative to introverts. Furthermore, Ss with higher psychoticism scores were less prone to overestimation of time intervals and showed better accuracy of temporal reproductions than Ss with lower psychoticism scores.},

	Abstract = {When subjects are asked to judge the duration and size of visually presented circles that vary in duration and size, perceived duration is directly related to stimulus size and perceived size is, in most cases, directly related to stimulus duration. When subjects are asked to process time and size information simultaneously, their time judgments are the same as when only time processing is required, but their size judgments are less than when only size processing is required. These data are discussed within the context of an explicit model for the processing of size information, added to which is the assumption that time judgments are influenced by the time spent processing size information.},

	Abstract = {A study was carried out in which age and gender differences were studied in the performance of an empty interval production task. The duration of these intervals was 10 s, 1 and 5 min. The sample was made up of 140 subjects, half male and half female, in seven different age groups from 8 to 70 years old. The age range permitted us to identify when differences begin to be significant. The results show an age-related increase in the underproduction of the intervals. The differences between age groups attained significance from 51 to 60 years onward. With regard to gender, the main result was a greater underproduction of longer intervals (1 and 5 min) for women. These findings were interpreted in terms of different models of time estimation},
